              The factor that makes Vietnamese tourism attractive comes from the
              spirit of the residential community. The friendliness and
              thoughtfulness when "guests come to the house" is a cultural
              beauty that has existed for thousands of generations of Vietnamese
              people. As one of the countries going through a lot of pain by
              war, but the friendliness in the way of life and human behavior is
              always present.

                  Hurley had spent time in Thailand, Malaysia, and Cambodia.
                  Coming to Asia was his first experience outside of his home
                  country. “I am very pleased with my choice to live in
                  Vietnam,” Hurley said. “Every country has its problems, but
                  overall, I am thoroughly impressed with the different aspects
                  of Vietnam, from the food and the people to the daily life.
                  "This is a place I want to live.” After being in Vietnam for
                  roughly four years, Hurley married a Vietnamese woman and got
                  a tattoo of Vietnam’s map. “I decided to get my Vietnam tattoo
                  after four years in the country," he said. "Even before I
                  started my YouTube channel, I felt like Vietnam had changed my
                  life forever, and it was one way for me to always remember my
                  second home.”

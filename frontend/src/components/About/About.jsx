          <p>
            Phu Quoc's gleaming white sand beaches have earned it the nickname
            "Pearl Island", but the island's environmental conservation efforts
            and cultural heritage deserve as much attention as its picturesque
            sand and surf. Fishing and agriculture remain primary industries,
            and more than half the laid-back island has been protected by a
            UNESCO Biosphere Reserve since 2006. Home to fish sauce, pepper, and
            pearls, Phu Quoc offers both luxury and local life, with clean water
            by day and clear skies at night.

              <p>
                In Vietnam, before eating we say “Chúc ngon miệng!”-- meaning
                'enjoy your meal' (but of course you will.) While Vietnamese
                cuisine abroad still flies under the banners of phở and bánh mì,
                the full spectrum of Vietnamese food is a symphony of
                delightfully textured, bright and piquant flavours. The
                Vietnamese love their food and cooks make the most of each
                region's abundance produce and special ingredients to make their
                meals.

                circuit of remote villages, camp within the largest caves on the
                planet, weave your way on a bike through highlands and
                coastline. Here are four adventurous holiday ideas for your next
                trip to Vietnam.
